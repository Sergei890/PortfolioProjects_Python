- [x] The aim of this task: To demonstrate the ability to perform intermediate-level technical tasks with both Python and Excel.
- [x] In **'Portfolio_Project_Python_1'** file I highlighted one of my **real job** tasks ðŸ§¾ that I did. <br/>

Previous colleague has made a report for management, but manager is not sure how the report was made and what were principles of selected data.
What we know for sure that only data in sheet "Data" was used. The task is to replicate the result so You get the same exact result as in sheet "To_Replicate".
Try to understand what data was selected and try to use as much of automatization as possible for final result, 
because we would like to refresh the source data and automatically update the Final result.
