# Welcome 👋
- [x] Here you can find some **short** projects which showcase my knowledge of Python.
- [x] In **'Portfolio_Project_Python_1'** file I highlighted one of my **real job** tasks 🧾 that I did. <br/>
      (The Data however was drastically reduced and changed for confidentiality reasons)
- [x] I tried to comment as much as possible, but the main idea of the file is to showcase the ability to use an appropriate code for different scenarios.
